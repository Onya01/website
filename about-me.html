   <h2>My name is Uchenna and living the simple life saved my life</h2>

   <p><strong>I used to be a pack rat</strong>. I had so many things that I thought that I learnd, but the truth was I couldn't even appraciate any of it because there too much.</p>

   <h3>How I turn things around</h3>
   <p><strong>I was on the verge of a brokedown when I got rid of everything</strong>. I literally put 90% of my possions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into smaller apartment, and I quit my job.</p>
   <p>It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me around me in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.</p>

   <h3>How I live the simple life</h3>
   <p>Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.</p>
   <p>With how much it turned my life around, <strong>I felt I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it</strong>, and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site</p>
